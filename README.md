## 💡 Introduction
Welcome to the Kidney_Disease_Detection project! 🏥 This repository focuses on solving the challenging task of classifying kidney disease using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a diverse set of blood indicators as features, we aim to accurately predict the presence of chronic kidney disease.

## 📂 Dataset
The chronic kidney disease dataset used in this project is sourced from the renowned UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a mix of categorical and numeric features; however, there is a significant amount of missing values that need to be handled effectively. 

📥 You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshayksingh/kidney-disease-dataset).

## 📦 Packages
To facilitate the kidney disease detection process, we have developed three self-defined packages. Let's take a look at each one:

1. **missing_values_table**: This package allows you to easily check the percentage of missing values within the dataset and presents them in a visually appealing table format. 📊

2. **Categorical_Imputer**: Dealing with categorical missing values can be challenging. But worry not! Our Categorical_Imputer package efficiently imputes categorical missing values using the most frequent values, ensuring the integrity of the dataset. 🛠️

3. **roc_auc**: Evaluating the performance of our classification model is crucial. The roc_auc package offers a self-defined function to generate and visualize the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, providing insights into the model's effectiveness. 📈
